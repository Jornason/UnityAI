![Elevation Demo](https://raw.github.com/jceipek/UnityAI/master/PathfindingDemo.png "Pathfinding Editor")

## Current Features

- Pathfinding editor for waypoints and pathing visualization
- A* Route Planning
- Random waypoint navigation

## TODO (in order of importance)

- Create a Waypoint follower that follows paths computed by Pathfinder
- Allow Waypoint followers to go "off-path" to reach goals close to waypoints
- Add support for navigation meshes
- Restructure `Assets/Editor/PathfindingEditor.js`, which is badly written
